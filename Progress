Day 1 Progress Report
1. Perfect Data Illusion (18.08.2025)

Today we discussed the concept of Perfect Data Illusion.

It happens when data looks "too clean" or "too perfect" compared to real-world data.

Real-world data usually contains missing values, noise, and outliers.


2. Exploring Data

Today I was exploring the StatsBomb Football Data from Kaggle.

StatsBomb provides one of the largest open datasets for football analytics.

It contains detailed event data (passes, shots, tackles, dribbles) as well as match data (teams, players, results).

The dataset is very detailed, covering multiple leagues and competitions.


Day 2 Progress (19.08.2025)
1) Discussed Huge Data in Context of Project and Model

Huge data is relative, not absolute. It depends on the complexity of the problem and the requirements of the ML model.

In this project, huge data means:

* A large number of players across multiple leagues and seasons.
* High-dimensional attributes (performance stats, age, position, injuries, etc.).

In this project’s context:

Huge data = sufficient quantity + variety + quality of player-related records.

Tasks Completed Today:

-StatsBomb Open Data
-Downloaded the complete StatsBomb Open Data ZIP file from the official GitHub repository.
-Verified the folder structure and availability of key JSON files.

2) Further Data Exploration


Day 3 Progress (20.08.2025)
Continued exploring StatsBomb datasets.
 Transfermarkt Data
	Downloaded player transfer datasets from Transfermarkt (ZIP format).
	Extracted files and placed them in local directories for preprocessing.
	Verified accessibility of all extracted files.


Day 4 Progress (21.08.2025)
Explored “ Market Value Data “ : Transfermarkt data from kaggle and downloaded the dataset provided and then I did the data scraping.


Day 5 Progress (22.08.2025)
I collected the Sentiment Analysis and then i explored it 
Also after that I started working on Twitter api
Now, I am working on collecting and analyzing players' injury history data to integrate it with the existing sentiment analysis.
I am left with the Twitter API part as it has some limit sort of thing.


Day 6 Progress (25.08.2025)
Today, I have successfully completed data scraping for players sentiment analysis using both the Twitter API. The collected data will now help in performing detailed sentiment evaluation and comparison across platforms.
