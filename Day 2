1) Discussed Huge Data in Context of Project and Model

Huge data is relative, not absolute. It depends on the complexity of the problem and the requirements of the ML model.

In this project, huge data means:

* A large number of players across multiple leagues and seasons.
* High-dimensional attributes (performance stats, age, position, injuries, etc.).

In this projectâ€™s context:

Huge data = sufficient quantity + variety + quality of player-related records.
