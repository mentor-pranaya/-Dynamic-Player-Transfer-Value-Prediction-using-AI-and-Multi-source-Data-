1) Combined Dataset Creation:
- Successfully merged data from Futbin (players data from futbin.csv) and Top5 Players (top5-players24-25.xlsx).
- Identified 'similar players' (players common in both datasets) and placed them at the top of the combined file.
- Remaining players (only in Futbin or only in Top5) were added continuously below.

2) Final Dataset Columns:
- Player Performance & Match Data (from Futbin)
- Market Value & Financial Data (from Top5)
- Sentiment & Popularity (placeholder column, to be filled later)
- Injury & Fitness Data (placeholder column)
- Advanced Analytics (placeholder column)

3) Output:
- Generated a combined CSV file `TransferIQ_Combined_Players.csv` containing structured information for further analysis.
- Ensured that similar players were given first preference in row ordering.
