- **Discussion Points:**  
  - Discussed in detail about what has to be achieved this week.  
  - Each intern to create a text/docs file and update it daily in their respective GitHub branches.  
  - A new question was given for discussion in the next session.  

## 2. Daily Work

- Market value extraction from Transfermarkt needs more structured approach.  

## 4. Tomorrow’s Question
- Mentor provided a discussion point for the next session:  
  **“Suppose you are collecting data for a machine learning project, and you notice that all your data is coming from a single source (for example, one device, one location, or one group of people). Do you think this dataset is reliable enough for building a general model? What risks could arise if the model is trained only on this source? How might the model behave when deployed in the real world on data from different sources? What would you do differently during data collection to avoid this problem?”**
