	 Retrieved the full StatsBomb Open Data ZIP from their official GitHub repo.
	 Unpacked the archive and organized datasets in local storagae.
	 Confirmed folder structure and checked availability of essential files:
	competitions.json → details of competitions & seasons
	 matches/ → match-level metadata
	 lineups/ → squad and player participation info
	 events/ → in-game actions (passes, shots, fouls, pressures, etc.)
	 three-sixty/ → freeze-frame player positioning
 Transfermarkt Data
	Downloaded player transfer datasets from Transfermarkt (ZIP format).
	Extracted files and placed them in local directories for preprocessing.
	Verified accessibility of all extracted files.
