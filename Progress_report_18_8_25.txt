1) StatsBomb Open Data (GitHub Repository) :

-Successfully downloaded datasets from the official StatsBomb Open Data GitHub

-Reviewed and explored the following categories of data:

	-Competitions & Seasons (competitions.json) – metadata regarding available competitions and seasons.

	-Matches (matches/) – match-level details including competition ID, season ID, participating teams, and scores.

	-Lineups (lineups/) – player participation information including squads, positions, and substitutions.

	-Events (events/) – detailed, event-level information for each match (shots, passes, pressures, fouls, etc.).

	-Three-Sixty Data (three-sixty/) – freeze-frame player positioning data around selected match events.

-All files are provided in JSON format and their structure was verified.

2) Transfermarkt Market Value Data :

-Initiated efforts to collect player market value history data from Transfermarkt.

-Investigated how player profile pages contain market value timelines embedded in JavaScript objects.

-Understood that extracting this data requires correctly identifying player IDs and parsing embedded scripts to obtain date–value pairs.

-Was not yet able to implement a complete extraction successfully; this task remains in progress.

CHALLENGES ENCOUNTERED :

-  Encountered difficulties in extracting structured market value data from Transfermarkt due to the complexity of parsing embedded JavaScript and mapping players to their respective Transfermarkt IDs.
