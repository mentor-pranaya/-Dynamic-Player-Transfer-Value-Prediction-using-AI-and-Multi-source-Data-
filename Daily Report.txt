Day-1


Today I successfully completed the data collection phase. I gathered player performance datasets from Futbin.com, FBref.com, and StatsBomb Open Data. These sources provide a good mix of detailed match statistics, historical records, and additional performance indicators 

Day-2


TransferIQ Project 

Date:2025-08-18

Tasks Completed Today:

StatsBomb Open Data (GitHub Repository)
	-Downloaded the complete StatsBomb Open Data ZIP file from the official GitHub repository.
	-Extracted and stored datasets locally for further use.
	-Verified the folder structure and availability of key JSON files:
	competitions.json (competitions & seasons metadata)
	matches/ (match-level details)
	lineups/ (player participation and squads)
	events/ (event-level data such as passes, shots, fouls, pressures)
	three-sixty/ (freeze-frame positioning data for events)
Transfermarkt Data
	-Downloaded datasets from Transfermarkt (ZIP file).
	-Stored the dataset locally for later preprocessing and analysis.
	-Verified that files were successfully extracted and accessible.
Day-3


1) Combined Dataset Creation:
- Successfully merged data from Futbin (players data from futbin.csv) and Top5 Players (top5-players24-25.xlsx).
- Identified 'similar players' (players common in both datasets) and placed them at the top of the combined file.
- Remaining players (only in Futbin or only in Top5) were added continuously below.

2) Final Dataset Columns:
- Player Performance & Match Data (from Futbin)
- Market Value & Financial Data (from Top5)
- Sentiment & Popularity (placeholder column, to be filled later)
- Injury & Fitness Data (placeholder column)
- Advanced Analytics (placeholder column)

3) Output:
- Generated a combined CSV file `TransferIQ_Combined_Players.csv` containing structured information for further analysis.
    - Ensured that similar players were given first preference in row ordering.

Day-4


Today, I successfully completed data scraping for players' sentiment analysis using both the Twitter API and Reddit. The collected data will now help in performing detailed sentiment evaluation and comparison across platforms.

Day-5


Today, I am working on collecting and analyzing players' injury history data to integrate it with the existing sentiment analysis.
