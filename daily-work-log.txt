I explored the StatsBomb Open Data from various sources available on GitHub. 
I went through the datasets related to player performance, match events, and competitions. 
I checked how the data is structured (JSON format) and understood the type of information available such as passes,
 shots, goals, and other performance metrics. I also practiced loading the data into Python using pandas for further analysis. 
 This exploration gave me a clear idea of how to use StatsBomb data for building player performance features in the project.
