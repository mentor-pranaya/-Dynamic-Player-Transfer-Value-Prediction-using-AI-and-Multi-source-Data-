--> 18 August 2025:

I explored the StatsBomb Open Data from various sources available on GitHub. 
I went through the datasets related to player performance, match events, and competitions. 
I checked how the data is structured (JSON format) and understood the type of information available such as passes,
 shots, goals, and other performance metrics. I also practiced loading the data into Python using pandas for further analysis. 
 This exploration gave me a clear idea of how to use StatsBomb data for building player performance features in the project.

--> 19 August 2025:

* Collected player performance data.
* Used GitHub as the source to access and manage the dataset.
* Verified the dataset structure for further analysis and processing.

--> 20 August 2025:

* Explored Transfermarkt data related to player market values.
* Understood how market value trends change over time for players.
* Preparing this data for integration with performance datasets.

Working on python and their liberaries to scrapting data.

Exploring Twitter api and scraping the data.

--> 23 August 2025:

Task Completed:

• Finished the data collection phase of the project.
• Collected player performance data from StatsBomb Open Data (2025 season).
• Gathered market value data for players from the latest Kaggle dataset (2025).
• Collected injury history data from Kaggle (covering years 2020–2023).
• Verified that all datasets were downloaded, stored properly, and are ready for cleaning and preprocessing.

Outcome:

Now I have three key datasets:

1. Performance data (2025) – detailed player stats.
2. Market value data (2025) – current transfer market values.
3. Injury data (2020–2023) – historical injury records.
