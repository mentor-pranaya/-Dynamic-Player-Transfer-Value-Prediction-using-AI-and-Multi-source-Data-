Daily Progress Report – Abhay Raj
Infosys Springboard Virtual Internship 6.0
-------------------------------------------

# Day 1 Progress Report
Date: 18/08/2025

1. Perfect Data Illusion
- Discussed the concept of Perfect Data Illusion.
- Real-world data usually has missing values, noise, and outliers.
- Perfectly clean data can be a bad sign (over-processing, fabrication, or lack of variability).

2. GitHub Setup
- Joined the GitHub repository using mentor’s invitation.
- Created my personal branch `abhay_raj`.
- Added a text file for daily updates.

3. Data Collection Exploration
- Explored StatsBomb Open Data for player performance datasets.
- Looked into Transfermarkt for player market value data.
- Searched initial sources for injury-related data.

4. Challenges
- Extracting structured data from Transfermarkt still needs more work.
- Injury data sources not finalized yet.

5. Tomorrow’s Question
- What is "huge data" in machine learning?
- Is it absolute (millions of rows, GBs) or relative to the model/problem?
- Could small datasets also be “huge” depending on context?

# Day 2 Progress Report
Date: 19/08/2025

1. Meeting Minutes (Recap from Mentor’s Mail)
- Agenda: Data Collection
- Discussed weekly goals.
- Each intern must update a text/docs file daily in their GitHub branch.
- Question for discussion given.

2. Daily Work
- Updated my branch with Day 1 report.
- Continued exploring StatsBomb Open Data.
- Reviewed Transfermarkt for player market values.

3. Challenges
- Injury dataset sources still unclear.
- Market value extraction needs structured approach.

4. Tomorrow’s Question
- Suppose data comes from a single source (one device/location/group).  
- Is it reliable for a general model?  
- What risks arise if trained only on this source?  
- How might it behave on unseen data?  
- What should be done differently during data collection?

# Day 3 Progress Report
Date: 20/08/2025

1. Meeting Minutes (Recap from Mentor’s Mail)
- Agenda: Data Collection
- Mentor clarified doubts.
- Discussed yesterday’s question.
- New discussion question assigned.

2. Daily Work
- Updated my branch with Day 2 progress.
- Continued exploring StatsBomb datasets.
- Analyzed Transfermarkt structure for market values.

3. Challenges
- Still need to find a reliable injury dataset.
- Transfermarkt extraction requires more formatting effort.

4. Tomorrow’s Question
- Which is more valuable for training ML models?  
  a) Large but narrow dataset (similar examples).  
  b) Smaller but diverse dataset (edge cases, variations).  
- Can a model trained on huge homogeneous data perform worse than one trained on fewer but varied samples?
