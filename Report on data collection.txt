I have successfully collected data collection Part:

I have collected Players’ general data from Transfermarkt,

And Sentiment analysis data from Reddit,

And Injury history data from Transfermarkt.

Right now, I have structured all these datasets in CSV format. I’m in the stage of merging them 

and preparing them for preprocessing. After that, I will move to the modeling part for 

predicting player transfer values.
