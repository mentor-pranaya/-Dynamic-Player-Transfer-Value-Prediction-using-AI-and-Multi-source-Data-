Day 1 Progress Report
1. Perfect Data Illusion
Today we discussed the concept of Perfect Data Illusion.

It happens when data looks "too clean" or "too perfect" compared to real-world data.

Real-world data usually contains missing values, noise, and outliers.


2. Exploring Data
Today I was exploring the StatsBomb Football Data from Kaggle.

StatsBomb provides one of the largest open datasets for football analytics.

It contains detailed event data (passes, shots, tackles, dribbles) as well as match data (teams, players, results).

The dataset is very detailed, covering multiple leagues and competitions.
