Daily Progress Report- Samarth Sukumar - 19/08/25

Tasks Completed:

-Worked on implementing a robust Transfermarkt web scraping script to collect market value history for all players in the English Premier League (2023/24 season).

-Integrated the following improvements into the scraper:

	-Retry logic to handle temporary server blocks (503 errors).

	-User-Agent rotation to mimic different browsers and reduce chances of being blocked.

	-Slower request delays to scrape politely and avoid server overload.

	-Resume functionality so scraping can continue from the last saved player in case of interruption.

-Ran initial tests of the scraper.

	-Successfully retrieved data for several players.

	-Observed that some players return 404 errors (indicating no market value history exists on Transfermarkt).

	-Confirmed that the code skips such players and continues scraping the rest without crashing.

Current Output:

-Data is being saved into the file:

	data_raw/transfermarkt/EPL_2023_24_market_values.csv


-Contains player-wise market value histories including date, value, age, and club information.

Challenges Faced:

-Encountered 503 Service Unavailable errors due to Transfermarkt blocking repeated requests. This was mitigated with retry logic, delays, and rotating headers.

-Some players (especially youth/lesser-known ones) have no available market value data, leading to 404 errors. These are being safely skipped.
