Day 1 Progress Report
1. Perfect Data Illusion (18.08.2025)

Today we discussed the concept of Perfect Data Illusion.

It happens when data looks "too clean" or "too perfect" compared to real-world data.

Real-world data usually contains missing values, noise, and outliers.


2. Exploring Data

Today I was exploring the StatsBomb Football Data from Kaggle.

StatsBomb provides one of the largest open datasets for football analytics.

It contains detailed event data (passes, shots, tackles, dribbles) as well as match data (teams, players, results).

The dataset is very detailed, covering multiple leagues and competitions.


Day 2 Progress (19.08.2025)
1) Discussed Huge Data in Context of Project and Model

Huge data is relative, not absolute. It depends on the complexity of the problem and the requirements of the ML model.

In this project, huge data means:

* A large number of players across multiple leagues and seasons.
* High-dimensional attributes (performance stats, age, position, injuries, etc.).

In this project’s context:

Huge data = sufficient quantity + variety + quality of player-related records.

Tasks Completed Today:

-StatsBomb Open Data
-Downloaded the complete StatsBomb Open Data ZIP file from the official GitHub repository.
-Verified the folder structure and availability of key JSON files.

2) Further Data Exploration


Day 3 Progress (20.08.2025)
Continued exploring StatsBomb datasets.
 Transfermarkt Data
	Downloaded player transfer datasets from Transfermarkt (ZIP format).
	Extracted files and placed them in local directories for preprocessing.
	Verified accessibility of all extracted files.


Day 4 Progress (21.08.2025)
Explored “ Market Value Data “ : Transfermarkt data from kaggle and downloaded the dataset provided and then I did the data scraping.


Day 5 Progress (22.08.2025)
I collected the Sentiment Analysis and then i explored it 
Also after that I started working on Twitter api
Now, I am working on collecting and analyzing players' injury history data to integrate it with the existing sentiment analysis.
I am left with the Twitter API part as it has some limit sort of thing.


Day 6 Progress (25.08.2025)
Today, I have successfully completed data scraping for players sentiment analysis using both the Twitter API. The collected data will now help in performing detailed sentiment evaluation and comparison across platforms.


Day 7 Progress (26.08.2025)
I have started data cleaning and i will complete the Twitter API work by today as only some part of it is left.


Day 8 Progress (28.08.2025)
Currently I am working on Data Cleaning and it will take some time rest the data collection part is done.


Day 9 Progress (29.08.2025)
Data collection has been done working on data cleaning.


Day 10 Progress (01.09.2025)
Data cleaning has been finished now i am working with data preprocessing.


Day 11 Progress (02.09.2025)
Today, I am working with data preprocessing as there was some error so I couldn't finish it after that I will first look in feature engineering and then start it.


Day 12 Progress (03.09.2025)
Data preprocessing has been completed now I will start with feature engineering.


Day 13 Progress (04.09.2025)
Todayy I'll start feature engineering after i complete feature engineering i will upload files on github.


Day 14 Progress (05.09.2025)
I am currently working on Feature Engineering it will be done with one to two days.


Day 15 Progress (08.09.2025)
Completed data preprocessing and feature engineering now I will start with data modelling.


Day 16 Progress (09.09.2025)
Today I started Data Modelling sentiment analysis is also done.


Day 17 Progress (10.09.2025)
I am working on Data Modelling as I am doing it for the first time so it will take some time for me to complete.


Day 18 Progress (11.09.2025)
I am still doing model development as i was stuck with some part.


Day 19 Progress (12.09.2025)
I have proceeded further with the model development and now i will start with unvariate LSTM model.


Day 20 Progress (15.09.2025)
After LSTM Model is completed i will work on Multivariate LSTM Model.


Day 21 Progress (16.09.2025)
I am currently working on LSTM model as it has some issues which I'll fix within some time. After that, I will start my work on Multivariate LSTM Model.


Day 22 Progress (17.09.2025)
LSTM model has been completed now I am working on Multivariate LSTM Model.


Day 23 Progress (18.09.2025)
Current working on Multivariate LSTM Model and i will be finishing it till the end of this week.


Day 24 Progress (19.09.2025)
I have procceded further with Multivariate LSTM Model but will take some time to finish.


Day 25 Progress (22.09.2025)
Working on the Multrivariate LSTM Model as some part is left in it also working on accuracy of the model.


Day 26 Progress (23.09.2025)
The Multrivariate LSTM Model is about to finish currently focusing on the accuracy of the model.


Day 27 Progress (24.09.2025)
Completed the Multivariate LSTM Model.


Day 28 Progress (25.09.2025)
Currently working on the ensemble models using XGBoost or LightGBM.


Day 29 Progress (27.09.2025)
I have started integrating the LSTM Models results with XGBoost to create an ensemble model. Rest everything i have uploaded in github.


Day 30 Progress (29.09.2025)
The ensemble model was created and  I have uploaded that on github now I am just working on the enhancing the model results through ensemble techniques, after that I will start with Hyperparameter tuning.


Day 31 Progress (30.09.2025)
I have successfully completed the enhancement of the model result through ensemble techniques, now will start with hyperparameter tuning.
