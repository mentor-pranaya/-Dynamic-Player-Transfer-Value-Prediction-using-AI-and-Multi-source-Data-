## Features Implemented

### Advanced Feature Engineering

#### Performance Trends
- **Rolling Averages**: 3, 5, and 10-period rolling means and standard deviations
- **Exponential Moving Averages**: Recent games weighted more heavily (Î± = 0.3, 0.5, 0.7)
- **Form Scores**: Z-scores comparing last 5 matches vs season average
- **Trend Analysis**: Linear regression slopes over rolling windows

#### Injury Impact Features
- **Recent Injury Indicators**: Binary flags for 30, 90, and 180-day injury periods
- **Injury Frequency**: Count of injury seasons and average days injured
- **Injury Severity**: Days injured as percentage of season
- **Injury-Adjusted Performance**: Performance metrics adjusted for available days
- **Injury Risk Score**: Composite score based on historical injury patterns

#### Time-Based Features
- **Career Stage**: Rookie, veteran, and peak age indicators
- **Year-over-Year Changes**: Percentage and absolute changes in key metrics
- **Performance Consistency**: Coefficient of variation for stability measures

#### Market Value Features
- **Market Value Growth**: Year-over-year percentage changes
- **Position Percentiles**: Market value rankings by position
- **Efficiency Metrics**: Performance per market value ratios

### Sentiment Analysis

#### Text Processing
- **Text Cleaning**: Remove URLs, mentions, hashtags, special characters
- **Stopword Removal**: Filter common English stopwords
- **Sentiment Scoring**: Both VADER and TextBlob analysis

#### Player-Level Aggregations
- **Mean Sentiment Scores**: Average sentiment across all tweets
- **Sentiment Volatility**: Standard deviation of sentiment scores
- **Sentiment Distribution**: Positive, negative, and neutral tweet ratios
- **Sentiment Trends**: Linear trend analysis over time

## Key Insights

### Performance Trends
- Rolling averages provide better trend detection than single-season metrics
- Form scores effectively identify players in good/bad form
- Exponential moving averages capture recent performance changes

### Injury Impact
- Recent injury indicators are strong predictors of performance decline
- Injury-adjusted metrics provide more accurate performance assessment
- Composite injury risk scores help identify injury-prone players

### Sentiment Analysis
- Social media sentiment correlates with player market value
- Sentiment volatility indicates uncertainty in player valuation
- Positive sentiment ratios are better predictors than raw sentiment scores

## Technical Implementation

### Error Handling
- Robust error handling for missing data and type mismatches
- Graceful fallbacks for missing sentiment analysis libraries
- Data type validation and conversion

### Performance Optimization
