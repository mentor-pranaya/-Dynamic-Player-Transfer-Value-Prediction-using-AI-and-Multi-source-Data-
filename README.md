DAY-1

data collected from statsbomb 

Today, I explored the StatsBomb dataset, which is centered around football analytics. The dataset contains detailed player information,
including attributes such as player name, nickname, player ID, team, rank, gender, and country. It offers a comprehensive foundation for conducting player profiling,
performance evaluation, and comparative analysis across teams and individuals.


DAY-2
data collected from kaggle 


Today I worked on the data scrapping using transfermarket data.
It contains information about football players, clubs, and transfers. 
It includes player details like age, nationality, and position, as well as club details and transfer history such as fees, dates, and types of transfers.
It also tracks player market value over time and performance stats like goals, assists, and appearances. This data can be used to study player value trends, club spending, and transfer strategies, and it can help in predicting future market values. Although the data needs cleaning and values change often, it is very useful for analysis, scouting, and research.
