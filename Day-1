Today, I spent some time exploring the StatsBomb Open Data available on GitHub. I looked through different datasets covering things like player performance, match events, and competitions. The data is in JSON format, so I took a closer look at how it's structured and what kind of information it includesâ€”like passes, shots, goals, and other key stats. I also practiced loading the data into Python using pandas to get comfortable working with it. Overall, it gave me a good understanding of how this data can be used to build useful features for analyzing player performance in my project.
